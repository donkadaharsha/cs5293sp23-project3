Fresno is located at the heart of 
California, and faces many social, 
economic and transportation challenges. Part 1 – VISION NARRATIVE  
1. Define your vision for your Smart City. Describe your city‟s challenges and
how the proposed elements of this proposed project can be used to address
those challenges. The vision should define your approach for implementing
and operating the demonstration project, including your program
management approach.
The City of Fresno envisions a Smart City comprised of an interconnected 
transportation network which is efficient, user-focused and embraces leading 
technology to address regional health, social and economic challenges. 
Challenges    
The City of Fresno comprises over 111 square miles in the San Joaquin Valley, and is 
California’s fifth most populated city at the geographic center of the state. Fresno serves 
as the economic hub of California’s Central Valley, with surrounding cities 
predominantly tied to large-scale agricultural 
production.  The San Joaquin Valley region is the 
17th largest agricultural area in the world, feeding 
one-third of the world’s population with $26 billion in 
agricultural production annually. However, amidst this 
agricultural abundance, real economic and health 
challenges exist. Poverty, unemployment, asthma 
and rates of obesity outpace state averages.  
Economic challenges faced by residents are 
troubling. According to the Economic Development 
Department, t he County-wide unemployment rate for 
2014 was 11.6%, compared to the statewide rate of 
7.5%. This rank ed Fresno County as 51 out of 58 
counties in the state for highest unemployment. Due 
to widespread poverty, all students in Fresno Unified 
School District are eligible for free meal programs. 
Over 79,000 free meals are served daily.   
Health indicators are also cause for concern. Obesity rates for 
adults in Fresno County are staggering, with 77% of residents 
identified as overweight or obese by the California Department 
of Public Health (CDPH), compared to 62.5% statewide. Rates 
of asthma prevalence are also high for children age 5-17 in 
Fresno County (23.6%), compared to statewide averages 
(17.1%).  The American Lung Association (ALA) ranks Fresno 1 
out of 220 metropolitan areas for annual particle pollution and 
24-hour particle pollution ratings . Given the ALA findings, and a 
2011 designation of Fresno by the World Health Organization as the second most air-
polluted city in the United States, the prevalence of asthma in Fresno is not surprising . 
According to the 
World Health 
Organization, in 
2011  Fresno was 
the second most 
air-polluted city 
in the United 
States.

ith disconcerting health and economic indicators, low educational attainment (just 
over 20% of residents hold a Bachelor’s degree or higher) and median household 
income resting at $42,015 per year, an economic catalyst is desperately needed to 
address health variables and create a healthier environment for the future.    
The economic center of Fresno has long migrated north; 
movement which has encroached on precious farmland 
while emptying the downtown area and creating urban 
sprawl .  Amidst these challenges, the City of Fresno is in 
a state of positive transformation. The need for 
reinvestment in the City’s downtown area has been the 
catalyst for a reexamination of development priorities 
over the last several years . Under the Swearengin 
Administration, the vision for large-scale investment in 
creating a more cohesive network for travel along inner -
city corridors, revitalizing key business districts and 
actively limiting urban sprawl has taken root to begin to 
address local challenges.  
A vision for transformative transportation is also underway, one that seeks to address 
social and economic challenges through investment in transportation infrastructure. The 
Smart City Challenge provides an unprecedented opportunity for Fresno to creatively 
address significant local health and economic challenges through transportation 
innovation and data sharing . The City of Fresno believes changing the built environment 
through smart transportation upgrades can have a positive impact on the overall 
wellness of residents. The challenges faced in Fresno are many, but can begin to be 
addressed through the development of a smart transportation system which 
synchronizes traffic signals throughout the city, encourages the use of electric vehicles  
and public transit alternatives, and engages residents in planning multi-modal trips and 
innovating with local data .  
Vision   
As a Smart City, Fresno would create a transportation system which:  
Operates with an interconnected transportation network utilizing advanced
Adaptive Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS ) to improve efficiency and
safety and reduce vehicle emissions.
Reduces congestion, addresses climate change and improves  air quality through
traffic synchronization, investment in electric vehicle charging infrastructure,
public transit infrastructure and resources which support active transportation.
Is user -focused; reducing barriers to mobility through information sharing, mobile
transit applications and open data.
Bolsters  opportunities for collaboration, continuous improvement,
entrepreneurship and innovation through public access to transportation metrics.
These vision elements can improve air quality, support more active transportation and 
facilitate greater equity in transportation across socioeconomic statuses. Furthermore, 
“We have to face the 
challenges of inner city 
Fresno and fix them, instead 
of ignoring them and 
pretending they will go away. 
Face and fix. ”

he potential economic impact of the Smart City challenge is exponential. A more 
effective transportation network and access to data can impact residents’ ability to 
commute to work with greater efficiency and safety, provide transportation information 
which can illuminate new insights into travel patterns, identify opportunities for 
innovation, and inform future policy and decision making. 
Program Management Approach   
This program would be managed through the development of a taskforce comprised of 
City of Fresno staff, business leaders , education al leaders and stakeholders to 
synergistically advance key vision elements and ensure effective process evaluation . 
Capital projects, parking and construction projects would be managed through the City 
of Fresno’s Public Works, Development and Parking departments . Information 
technology components of the vision elements presented will be managed by the 
Information Services Department (ISD). Public transit upgrades would be overseen by 
the City of Fresno’s Transportation D epartment. Reporting requirements would be 
managed through the City’ s Grants and Financial Administrators, ensuring timely and 
comprehensive reporting. Numerous letters of support from both public and private 
partners are also attached to this application and demonstrate a commitment to a multi-
disciplinary program management approach. 
2. Describe the population characteristics of your city and show how it aligns
with the USDOT‟s characteristics for a Smart City, including:
a.Mid-size city with population between approximately 200,000 and
850,000 people in the city limits;
b.Dense urban population; and
c.Represents a significant portion (preferably more than 15%) of the
population of your local urbanized area.
According to Census 2010 data, the City of Fresno has a demographically diverse 
population of 494,665 residents. Thirty percent of residents are Hispanic or Latino, and 
over 12% of residents identify as Asian. According to 2010 Census calculations, the City 
of Fresno possesses a dense urban population with 76% of residents residing in a local 
urbanized area. This is a significant portion of the population. The City of Fresno is also 
the 34th most populous city in the nation. These demographic characteristics , 
particularly the significant diversity and vast urbanized area, uniquely qualify the City of 
Fresno as an ideal mid-size Smart City. 
3. Describe other characteristics of your city and show how it aligns with the
USDOT‟s characteristics for a Smart City, including:

 clear commitment to making open, machine-readable data
accessible, discoverable and usable by the public to fuel
entrepreneurship and innovation.
Existing Public Transportation System  
The City of Fresno has an evolving public transportation system, which provides a great 
foundation for advancement to the Smart City Challenge. The public transit options are 
numerous. In terms of bus transit, Fresno Area Express (FAX) is comprised of 16 fixed 
routes spanning the city and connecting with neighboring transit systems to optimize the 
ease of commute for residents.  
FIGURE 1 |  The e xisting fixed route publi c transportation system is known as

respects, rubber-
tired light rail transit 
with greater 
operating flexibility 
and potentially lower 
costs.

Investment in public transit solutions will help to 
reduce emissions in an area plagued by poor air 
quality. Image: Craig Kohlruss, MCT/Getty Images 
for Tme.com. The FAX fixed routes typically follow many of the City’s arterial roadways, which are 
generally spaced with a one-half to one-mile separation. Most of the FAX routes operate 
at 30-minute frequencies, with four routes providing 20-minute frequencies during peak 
commute periods. There are two routes, ( 45 & 58) which operate on 60-minute 
frequencies. Within the next year, FAX will establish two 15-minute routes near Fresno 
State, along portions of Shaw (East and West) and Cedar (North and South) routes . 
The Shaw and Cedar routes will serve as companions for a planned Bus Rapid Transit 
System.  
A first phase Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) system is planned and 
funded along the Ventura Street/Kings Canyon Road and the 
Blackstone Avenue corridors, meeting in downtown (Figure 
2). Groundbreaking for the BRT is expected in 2016, with 
service planned in 2017. BRT is an integrated system of 
facilities, equipment, services and amenities that improve the 
speed, reliability and identi ty of bus transit. BRT is, in many 
respects, rubber-tired light rail transit with greater operating 
flexibility and potentially lower costs. 
A demand-response service, Handy Ride , provides transportation for eligible persons 
with disabilities who cannot functionally use the fixed route system.  FAX services over 
2,700 clients, with over 700 weekday passenger trips.  The Handy Ride  service area is 
the same as FAX’s fixed route syste m. The FAX bus system also provides connections 
to the Amtrak passenger rail station and the Greyhound bus station, both of which are 
located in Downtown. The bus route system is focused primarily on heavily urban areas, 
with fewer services offered to urban edge development. This focus allows the City to 
maximize ridership and reduce congestion in urban areas. FAX partners with the City of 
Clovis transit system, The City of Visalia V-Line, and the Fresno County Rural Area 
Transit Agency to provide connections outside of the City.  
Additionally, phase one of the California 
High Speed Rail (HSR) Project , the largest 
of its kind in the nation, is slated to run 
through the City of Fresno with estimated 
construction completion by 20 19 and final 
route completion by 2029. HSR will serve 
as a regional transportation system for 
Fresno and surrounding communities. The 
HSR tracks through Fresno’s metropolitan 
area w ill run generally parallel to the Union 
Pacific Railroad tracks. A HSR station will 
be located in Fresno, and it is anticipated 
that the HSR system would significantly 
increase the accessibility of Fresno to 
major population and economic hubs of 
California.

7 Environment that is conducive to demonstrating proposed strategies 
The City of Fresno has an environment that is conducive to 
demonstrating proposed strategies , 
and a track record of embracing 
technology to advance city priorities. In 
2013, the City of Fresno was one of 31 
cities selected worldwide to receive the 
IBM Smarter Cities Challenge grant. 
The city of Fresno was recognized as a Smart er City due to 
unique assets which also make it a prime candidate for this 
challenge. These assets include diversity, affordability, 
proximity to larger cities, and well-developed relationships that create synergies across 
industries. As a past Smarter City, Fresno demonstrated the ability to engage with key 
stakeholders to collectively envision an instrumented, interconnected and intelligent City 
that utilizes data to inform decision making and enhance the economic health and 
overall wellbeing of residents. Key recommendations emerged from Smarter City 
funding which related to open data and collective efforts to advance change .  These key 
recommendations poise Fresno to initiate greater collaboration with businesses, dial 
into urban analytics, and foster more robust partnerships with universities and citizens 
as a Smart City. 
The City of Fresno also has a history of leading the way on cutting edge technologies, 
and transferring knowledge gained to others. In 2009, Fresno Yosemite International 
Airport (FAT) was selected by the Federal Aviation Administration as one of 10 airports 
nationwide , one of only two located on the west coast, for funding to develop a 
Sustainability Management Plan  which was released in 
2012. The resulting plan has laid the groundwork for a 
commitment to a green city which protects the 
environment and promotes smart growth. A 2-megawatt 
solar power generation system installed at FAT in 2008 
was the nation’s first  of its size at an airport, and has 
resulted in generating 30,002,118 kWh of solar energy to 
date. This is the equivalent of the CO 2 absorbed by 
118,403 trees and the CO 2 emitted from driving 
17,365,037 miles. Based on best practices and lessons learned t he City of Fresno 
Airports Department has provided technical assistance to 
support other region’s green efforts. This trac k record of 
leadership in green energy and transportation technology 
demonstrates an environment in Fresno which welcomes and 
encourages innovation of the scope and scale required to 
achieve a Smart City vision.  
The environment in terms of existing transportation 
infrastructure, experienced engineering staff, information 
technology staff and technical staff is also uniquely poised to 
embrace the Smart City Challenge. The resources which

8 create an environment conducive to demonstration will be discussed at length in 
questions 7,8,12 and 13 of this application. 
Continuity of committed leadership and capacity to carry out the demonstration 
throughout the period of performance 
Leadership in the City of Fresno is invested in a long-term vision for city-wide 
improvements, particularly with regards to transportation. The City of Fresno General 
Plan 2035  casts a vision for smart growth, multimodal travel enhanced by technological 
innovation, and a commitment to the use of evaluation metrics and performance 
standards to prioritize transportation projects and focus on continuous improvement. 
The City has also committed to a county-wide plan for Intelligent Transportation 
Systems and a Fiber Optics Communication Network, which align to m any of the 
proposed elements in this grant. Existing momentum toward c omprehensive 
connectivity which reflects a balanced multimodal transportation system makes the City 
of Fresno an ideal candidate for a connected Smart City.  
Directors overseeing the Departments of Public Works , Development, Transportation 
and Information Services are highly experienced and have united in support of this 
proposal. Becoming a Smart City would accelerate existing plans by providing otherwise 
unmet funding . The city has successfully executed large scale capital and technical 
projects and has the internal leadership capacity and organizational structure to carry 
out the demonstration throughout the period of performance with excellence. 
A commitment to integrating with the sharing economy 
Fresno has a demonstrated commitment to integrating into the sharing economy. This is 
evidenced by partnerships with the region’s largest university, and  business activity in 
Downtown Fresno.  In 2014, California State 
University Fresno (CSUF) and the City of Fresno 
partnered on a request to receive technical 
assistance from the Environmental Protection 
Agency (EPA) to explore bike share programs. The 
findings of the report, released in November 2015, 
have helped to inform several of the vision 
elements in this proposal.  CSUF is currently 
exploring shared digital bike locking systems and 
remains open to other opportunities.  
Growth of businesses in Downtown Fresno 
demonstrates the growth of the sharing economy in 
the local private sector. In May 2015 Uber opened 
a downtown office , followed a few months later by 
the launch of Uber Español in November 2015. 
Many local companies like BitWise and Hashtag 
also utilize sharing economy principles by working 
out of shared spaces and utilizing shared 
equipment to bring their products to market.  
In 2015, the EPA provided technical 
assistance for Bikeshare planning in 
Fresno which produced the report 
pictured above.

regional Integrated Transportation System Plan  and numerous studies developed by 
transportation experts. The City of Fresno is committed to executing these vision 
elements with excellence so that they may serve as a replicable and scalable model 
nationwide. 
Vision Element #1: Urban Automation 
Driver-assisted automation  has the potential to increase efficiency and safety while 
decreasing congestion and improving public transportation systems. The City of Fresno 
plans to partner with Mobileye Shield+ to equip buses with the hardware 
and software required to improve collision avoidance . The City of 
Fresno’s approach to urban automation also involves the use of 
enhanced Global Positioning Software (GPS) technology  to ensure 
public transit buses remain on-route and on-schedule. Existing 
technology solutions utilized in the City’s public transportation system 
include Automated Vehicle Location (AVL) and s cheduling software provided by 
Trapeze ITS which allows for real-time tracking of fleet buses and vehicles. Funding 
from the Smart City Challenge would allow for retrofit of buses with mobile data 
terminals  to assist drivers. Additionally, the City has been approached by Google X, to 
discuss the feasibility of piloting automated vehicles  in the area if selected as a Smart 
City. A letter of support from Google X is included with this application. These 
automated additions to the local  transit system can enhance the public transit 
experience by improving timeliness , informing new ways to automate travel in an 
urbanized area and reducing costs incurred due to route delays.  
Vision Element #2: Connected Vehicles 
 Vehicle to Infrastructure (V2I) connectivity is a key element of the City of 
Fresno’s vision. V2I connectivity would be achieved through the 
development of intelligent, Sensor-based infrastructure or Intelligent 
Transportation Systems (ITS) throughout the City,  and a pilot  of 
Dedicated Short Range Communications (DSRC) systems along a 
key route. The ITS system would allow f or V2I signal  preemption, while 
the DSRC system would transmit synchronization speeds, and potentially freeway and 
ramp information to vehicles. Due to its emerging nature, DSRC would be placed as a 
pilot along a key corridor such as Blackstone. As part of this pilot, the City is also 
interested in exploring V2I connections to mobile phone users. 
Emergency preemption systems  would utilize V2I technology that can override traffic 
signals in emergency situations utilizing Mobile Infrared Transmitters along the ITS 
system. These emergency preemption systems would allow a greater number of 
emergency personnel including ambulances and Police to more safely respond to 
accidents and emergencies. Traffic Signal prioritization could also be expanded to 
public transit with Smart City funding. This would allow buses along key corridors to 
notify Adaptive ITS traffic signals of their impending approach and receive more “green 
time” to get through each signalized intersection. This would alter adaptive sig nal timing

using infrared technology allowing for a more rapid public transit system. This vision 
element works in conjunction with the City of Fresno’s vision for a more synchronized 
traffic system which encourages the use of public transit by offering user-focused, 
efficient and timely services.  
Inter-city passenger transfer communications  for public 
transit operations are currently utilized when transporting 
FAX riders to other nearby cities. Connected V2V technology 
could further develop this communication system to allow for 
greater levels of automation. This would be achieved by 
upgrades to the existing Automated Vehicle Location 
programs on key routes. These upgrades would support 
other vision elements of this proposal, such as urban 
automation, user-focused transit, synchronization and the use of data and analytics to 
provide for greater  synchronization between cities. With all of these vision elements 
working synergistically, public transit will ultimately become the most desirable way to 
navigate an increasingly urban area. 
Vision Element #3: Intelligent, Sensor-Based Infrastructure 
The key to the successful implementation and realization of synergies 
between vision elements lies in the foundational delivery of Vision 
Element 3, the adoption of intelligent, sensor-based infrastructure 
throughout the city . The City of Fresno proposes to install Adaptive 
Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) in nearly all city intersections , 
and signal interconnect infrastructure along freeway 180 and 99 exits . 
Adaptive Intelligent Transportation systems allow for real time automated adjustment 
between signals to cater to variant traffic needs and mitigate congestion. Funding from 
the Smart City Challenge would enable the City of Fresno to retrofit and construct 
Adaptive ITS at 300-400 traffic signals . Approximately 7% of the city’s 466 traffic signals 
are currently adaptive or in the process of being updated to adaptive technologies. 
Approximately 2 92 traffic signals have the fiber or wireless communications installed to 
become adaptive, but are in need of detection upgrades and adaptive technology. The 
remaining signals are in need of full ITS construction including communication for 
adaptive synchronization. The installation of fiber optic infrastructure along State Rout e 
99 and Jensen Avenue Corridors will be required to retrofit traffic signals along the 
corridors with Adaptive ITS using fiber and wireless communications . Experience from 
past adaptive synchronization projects provides the City of Fresno with the practical 
knowledge and expertise to execute an adaptive synchronization project of this scale . 
Figure 3 on page 24 demonstrates the extensive project portfolio for FY2016, and long-
term plans for regional ITS.  
The installation of fiber-optic cables along two remaining corridors would provide traffic 
signal interconnect back to the Tra ffic Operations Center (TOC). Fiber hubs along the 
corridors would be established to allow for connections . ITS elements such as CCTV 
cameras, ITS communication cabinets and Opticom Emergency Vehicle Preemption 
With all of these vision 
elements working 
synergistically, public 
transit will ultimately 
become the most 
desirable way to 
navigate an increasingly 
urban area.

Equipment would be included throughout the system. The City has standardized Type 
332 traffic signal cabinets and would utilize standard 5.2-5.8 GHz wireless network 
equipment to extend fiber communications across the remaining city signals. This would 
result in a significant cost savings, as it would eliminate the need for installation of 
infrastructure underground.  
The City of Fresno has an existing Intelligent Transportation Systems Master Plan  in 
place for the next 20 years through the Fresno Region’s Council of Governments . This 
plan reflects an incremental roll out of ITS as funding becomes available. However, 
Smart City funding would accelerate deployment and allow the City of Fresno to benefit 
from the insights that come with early, large-scale adoption.  The technology that would 
be adopted throughout the City of Fresno as part of the Smart City challenge follows the 
U.S. department of Transportation’s Intelligent Transportation Systems 2015-2019 
Strategic Plan for ITS programs by serving as a foundation for interoperability and a 
source for enterprise data . The City of Fresno has published Standard Drawings and 
Specifications that are utilized for all new traffic signal and ITS installations and 
modifications. 
Adaptive ITS infrastructure, hardware and software throughout the city would 
provide traffic and emissions data which could benefit operations, researchers and 
open opportunities for private sector innovation.  Traffic and emissions data would be 
generated from key corridors, while traffic data patterns could be collected on a larger 
scale. The partnership opportunities this equipment provides, and the extensive data to 
be collected as part of this demonstration will be discussed in greater detail in questions 
7 and 9. 
Vision Element #4: Urban Analytics 
The 21st Century is a data-rich environment in which a Smart City can 
leverage performance data for informed decision-making and problem 
solving across multiple policy areas . Data is currently generated by 
public transit programs and the Traffic Operations Center. Adaptive ITS 
software throughout the city would provide intersection specific 
urban analytics including traffic patterns, arterial travel time, green 
times, volumes and  volume to capacity ratios.  These analytics could be used for 
traffic modeling to identify opportunities for road-diets , or locate areas with excessive 
queuing and emissions. This data could also provide information regarding pedestrian 
crosswalk use, which would inform the C ity’s long-term active transportation planning. 
These respective datasets can be analyzed to establish baseline operations numbers, 
and the impact of Smart City vision elements to traffic flow, emission reductions and 
greater use of public transit. The City’s commitment to dialing in on  urban analytics 
works synergistically to improve the effectiveness of the transportation system city-wide 
and capture the impacts of implementing numerous vision elements in this challenge. 
Generating data to inform transportation decisions will provide a cost-benefit in the form 
of greater efficiency and the ability to demonstrate tangible impacts to the environment.

Existing trip planning 
services would be 
further enhanced.  This is also a vision element which our university and private partners find enormous ly 
valuable. Providing urban analytics data can aide scholars in identifying new insights, 
and the private industry in more effectively managing urban logistics and planning. 
Vision Element #5: User-Focused Mobility Services and Choices 
The City of Fresno’s vision for user -focused mobility services and choices 
includes a number of upgrades to public transit such as enhanced 
dynamic travel planning services, enhanced ticket vending and rider 
notification systems, user-oriented parking and greater support for the 
sharing economy through investment in mobile bike share. 
Dynamic Travel Planning Services 
The City has launch ed a transportation website that is mobile friendly to aide residents 
in planning their public transit routes. This website is called Plan my Trip . As a Smart 
City, Fresno envisions expanding on this website to provide real-time public transit 
information , and increased access to public transportation services for all residents. 
Real-time transit information generally includes information on projected vehicle arrival 
and departure times, service disruptions and delays, transfers and other transportation 
services; as well as other related information, such as date and time, weather, public 
announcements, security related information, updates during terrorist/emergency 
events, and other general events in the local area. This 
information is provided to assist riders in making pre-trip and en 
route (including in-vehicle) trip decisions.  Next generation 
programming would also allow for the integration of location-
based trip planning , utilizing Google Maps ‘Where am I?’ 
technology. These website enhancements would be cost effective 
as they would benefit from Google generated data and could be 
layered on to an existing web-based service.  
Moreover, the provision of real-time transit information would help 
to improve the visibility of transit services within the community .  In addition to web-
based information, access to trip information would be made through a variety of 
media , including dynamic message signs (DMS) at stops and stations; kiosks at bus 
shelters, office buildings, shopping centers and other locations.   Currently FAX is one of 
two agencies in the region with a real-time Automated Vehicle Locator (AVL).  However, 
as other agencies upgrade, it will be possible to work toward integration into a fully 
regional system.  
Enhanced Transit Ticket Vending 
To expand user-focus, the City of Fresno also envisions upgrading FAX Ticket 
Vending Machines (TVM) and adopting Smart Card technology . TVM  kiosks located 
alongside Bus Rapid Transit routes would be updated to accept Smart Cards and high-
tech payment options such as Apple Pay and Google Pay. These payment capabilities 
would make payment more modernized and convenient for users. The ability to pay for 
Smart Cards online would also be added. Additional updates to TVM kiosks would

Existing city meters 
would be replaced 
with Smart Meters.  
include 36-character LED signs  along key areas of the BRT route which will provide 
greater capacity to display more information such as station information, ticketing 
information, schedule and next arriving bus. 
Rider Notification Systems 
Greater user-focus would be achieved through the use of rider notification systems 
which can send SMS text messages to registered riders  in advance of the arrival of 
their FAX bus or Handy Ride utilizing AVL software. This eliminates the need for users  
to wait at bus stations for long periods of time by providing real-time updates and push 
notifications to mobile devices. This technology could also enable users to text message 
a standardized number to receive real-time updates on the status of their next arriving 
bus.  
User-Oriented Parking Services 
Upgraded parking services in the downtown area would improve 
on-street and off-street parking solutions for residents and 
mitigate congestion. On-street parking services would be 
streamlined through the use of smart meter technology which 
would replace standard coin-operated meters . Tiered 
capabilities  would allow the City to adjust pricing structure and 
timing digitally, which would result in the ability to open up street 
meters during events with set fee pricing, and respond to 
demand. This could help offset the congestion that occurs at 
existing lots. Off-street parking would be improved through the 
use of  digital „pay-on-foot ‟ stations  to reduce traffic congestion 
and CO 2 levels at the point of exit at 13 parking garages and lots. 
The smart parking solutions discussed would provide reporting features related to 
usage, revenue and repairs needed. 
The Sharing Economy 
The City of Fresno would like to explore micro transit opportunities  to streamline 
public transportation routes utilizing the sharing economy, electric vehicles and 
vouchers for seniors. To achieve this, the City would  examine areas with less ridership 
along fixed route bus systems (for example Cedar from Herndon to Friant, where 
ridership gets sparse) and divert buses from that less popular portion of the route to 
areas with higher demand. This would increase frequencies along routes with higher 
ridership. The City would encourage the use of ride-sharing services to fill in the gap, 
and is open to partnership opportunities to encourage the use of electric vehicles for 
ridesharing. The City would also explore providing vouchers for seniors with the Council 
of Governments and ride-sharing companies to expand mobility and address the “last -
mile” challenges of public transit  via the sharing economy. 
New technology also provides unprecedented opportunities for the sharing economy to 
flourish, particularly when it comes to Bikeshare programs  and high-tech bike rack 
equipment. Through a partnership with California State University Fresno (CSUF), the 
City of Fresno would implement recommendations from the Environmental Protection "	fresno existing meter would replaced meter include character led sign along key area brt route provide greater capacity display information station information ticketing information schedule next arriving bus rider notification system greater user focus would achieved use rider notification system send sm text message registered rider advance arrival fax bus handy ride utilizing avl software eliminates need user wait bus station long period time providing real time update push notification mobile device technology could also enable user text message standardized number receive real time update status next arriving bus user oriented parking service upgraded parking service downtown area would improve street street parking solution resident mitigate congestion street parking service would streamlined use meter technology would replace standard coin operated meter tiered capability would allow adjust pricing structure timing digitally would result ability open street meter event set fee pricing respond demand could help offset congestion occurs existing lot street parking would improved use digital pay foot station reduce traffic congestion co level point exit parking garage lot parking solution discussed would provide reporting feature related usage revenue repair needed sharing economy fresno would like explore micro transit opportunity streamline public transportation route utilizing sharing economy electric vehicle voucher senior achieve would examine area le ridership along fixed route bus system example cedar herndon friant ridership get sparse divert bus le popular portion route area higher demand would increase frequency along route higher ridership would encourage use ride sharing service fill gap open partnership opportunity encourage use electric vehicle ridesharing would also explore providing voucher senior council government ride sharing company expand mobility address last mile challenge public transit via sharing economy new technology also provides unprecedented opportunity sharing economy flourish particularly come bikeshare program high tech bike rack equipment partnership california university fresno csuf fresno would implement recommendation environmental protection	15

Businesses could 
proactively plan and 
coordinate delivery and 
logistics to cut costs and 
improve air quality.  Agency’ s 2015 Bike Share Plan  by establishing a bike share system.   For a nominal fee, 
this system would allow students and pedestrians to utilize a bike to travel around 
campus or to nearby FAX stops. This would eliminate barriers to cycling by providing 
publicly available access to bicycles, and create greater amenities to attract students . It 
would also solve a common “last -mile” challenge in public transit by providing greater 
transportation options to link between bus stops and final destinations. Bicycles would 
be tracked using GPS technology. In addition to a Bikeshare program, the City would 
also like to install mobile device operated locking bike racks  throughout key regions 
of Fresno. This would provide a space for residents engaged in active transportation to 
secure their bicycle as they travel to their next destination. 
The user-focused services to support mobility and choices in transportation would result 
in a significant collective impact .  Greater access to public transit and bicycles would 
support improved air quality and a streamlined system which would encourage multi-
modal movement throughout the City. User-focused options could reduce long-term 
overhead costs for City transportation and parking departments through greater 
automation and a more complete spectrum of analytics to utilize when planning. All of 
these features would work synergistically to create a more connected community 
through the use of advanced technologies. 
Vision Element #6: Urban Delivery and Logistics 
Data sharing is key to supporting long-term urban delivery and logistics 
planning. According to the 2013 IBM Smarter Cities Challenge  findings, 
the City of Fresno is positioned to embrace the use of technology in 
agricultural production and transport.  Bui lding on that momentum, the 
Smart City Challenge would allow Fresno to provide transportation 
data generated by ITS equipment through third -party partnerships . 
This would enable end-users to identify traffic patterns and design route delivery and 
logistics schedules around peak periods. Fleet managers could also opt to analyze data 
to determine the best routes to deploy the electric vehicles in their fleet. For example, 
data from the City could be analyzed to support the allocation of electric vehicles in 
delivery fleets to strategic areas with greater congestion to reduce the environmental 
impact of deliveries and fuel costs . Transit data sharing to support urban delivery and 
logistics could occur through software such as OpenGov which would allow anonymized 
transit specific datasets to be made public through the City of Fresno website.  
The combined impact of supporting Urban Delivery and 
Logistics through data sharing would create a  highly-tuned 
transportation environment in which businesses could 
proactively plan and coordinate delivery and logistics to cut 
costs and improve air quality. The resulting impacts may 
ultimately lead to improvements to economic and health 
indicators in the City.

The Lyles School of 
Engineering and the 
Community Regional 
Planning Center are key 
partners in the Smart 
City Challenge.  Vision Element #7: Strategic Business Models and Partnering Opportunities 
The City of Fresno is home to several universities, community colleges 
and technical programs, the 4th largest school district in the state of 
California, a thriving tech hub located in the downtown area, and an 
emerging creative scene responsible for engaging young professionals in 
bettering their community. These traits, along with longstanding 
relationships make Fresno an ideal location for public-private 
partnerships. Letters of support included in this application demonstrate 
multidisciplinary and cross-cutting enthusiasm for Smart City collaboration.  
The City of Fresno envisions partnership with many government partners  including 
the Fresno Council of Governments, the County of Fresno, California Department of 
Transportation, Fresno County Office of Education and s urrounding cities to accomplish 
infrastructural plans and efforts to interconnect fiber optics. The City of Fresno has 
worked closely with these partners for many years and is confident in continued 
collaboration. Bringing together leaders in the industry from across institutions will result 
in a more coordinated deployment and mitigate unnecessary costs associated with a 
lack of proactive planning.   
Fresno also foresees partnership with school districts, 
technology companies and universities  to make publicly 
accessible datasets available to entrepreneurial programs, 
and engage the millennial generation in identifying new 
opportunities for multimodal and connected transit. These 
partners will play a key role in applying transportation insights 
to solve social and economic challenges locally. California 
State University Fresno ’s (CSUF) Department of 
Transportation is interested in partnering on bikeshare efforts 
and there is widespread support from the University to 
maximize the urban analytics collected. Letters of support 
have been provided from CSUF’s Office of Community and 
Economic Development, Lyles Department of Engineering, Lyles Center for Innovation 
and Entrepreneurship and the CSUF Community Regional Planning Center.  
Private partnerships  are also key to the success of a Smart City. The City of Fresno 
has been contacted by many potential private partners. If selected, the City would like to 
explore partnership with Google X for the urban automation vision element included in 
this proposal, and discuss opportunities for increased mobility with ride-sharing 
companies. Fiat of Fresno has also communicated interest in supporting electric vehicle 
vision elements and  BitWise Industries is also highly interested in collaboration.  It is

Vision Element #8: Smart Grid, Roadway Electrification and Electric Vehicles 
As electric vehicles (EVs) become more widely available, the City of Fresno aims to  
encourage their use through providing charging stations  at 5-10 locations throughout 
the City for public use, as well as City fleet charging stations . This would 
result in a 50-100% increase in publicly available charging locations in 
Fresno. Ideal locations include stations near City Hall, downtown, along 
“Park and Ride” lots, near public transit and High Speed Rail facilities and 
close to exits along the State Route 99 and 180 freeways . Station types 
would vary based on projected charge time. Charging stations will create 
greater incentive for the adoption of electric or hybrid vehicles, as there 
are currently limited locations to charge them within the city . The City also envisions 
upgrading approximately 30% of the parking enforcement fleet and approximately 
60% of public transit support vehicles to EVs.  If selected, the City plans to dialogue 
with electric utility service providers regarding feasibility of charging station interface 
with a local smart -grid pilot effort . This would allow users to charge vehicles in long-
term parking during off-peak periods. Finally, to incentivize electric vehicle use, the City 
plans to explore partnership with local EV retailers  to connect ride-share service 
providers to electric vehicle solu tions. This would not only increase the use of EV’s, but 
also support the increased mobility elements of this proposal. The City of Fresno’s plans  
for electric vehicle infrastructure work in synergy with the overall vision for a 
coordinated, user-focused and environmentally friendly transportation system city-wide 
by providing the tools for residents to more fully adopt EV transportation options.  
Vision Element #9: Connected, Involved Citizens 
To support greater citizen engagement, the City of Fresno plans to install 
Free Public WiFi on City buses along BRT routes and stations . The 
installation would also support the City’s vision to increase  user-focused 
mobility. Providing free access to the internet while using public transit 
can aide users in planning their trip, multitasking on their way to and from 
work or school, and serve as an incentive to adopt more multi -modal or 
car-light lifestyles. In addition to WiFi, the City of Fresno plans to engage and inform 
citizens of advanced technologies through the deployment of targeted  informational 
and social media campaigns  and dedicated Smart City web space. These campaigns 
would encourage the use of public transit and  exploration of tools that enable citizens to 
engage in the connected transportation system. Tools to be promoted include the 
availability of WiFi at BRT publ ic transit centers, promotion of the FresGo application 
and promotion of available City data sets.

Screenshot of FresGo, Fresno’s  
crowd-sourced reporting system. 
The City of Fresno currently utilizes crowd-sourced 
data to identify needed repairs around the city. This 
engagement could be increased to identify public 
transit needs by further developing the FresGo 
application to receive comments and allow users 
to rate their public transit travel experience . 
This would provide customer service feedback and 
allow the City of Fresno to observe trends. Actively 
promoting advanced technologies, available data 
sets and opportunities to generate insights through 
the use of crowd-sourcing would result in a smart 
transportation system which engages citizens in 
digital democracy. This could result in reduced 
overhead costs and a measureable impact on 
future operations based on user feedback. 
Vision Element #10: Architecture and Standards 
The foundational component of the Smart City Vision for the City of 
Fresno is Information Technology Systems which are interoperable and 
can be iterated in surrounding areas . The architecture and standards for 
existing and planned Adaptive ITS infrastructure under vision element 
number three would follow the Department of Transportation’s Connected 
Vehicle Reference Implementation Architecture (CVRIA) and Systems 
Engineering Tool for Intelligent Transportation SET-IT software tools. The City is 
committed to following established architecture and standards to reduce installation and 
maintenance costs, and create seamless connectivity. 
Vision Element #11: Low-Cost, Efficient, Secure, and Resilient Information and 
Communications Technology 
The City of Fresno is committed to low-cost, efficient, secure and resilient 
information and communications technology that ensures privacy and 
information safety. To that end, the City of Fresno would invest in 
additional hardware to manage public facing servers as part of a sub-
network or “demilitarized zone” (DMZ).  “Big data ” is a key component of 
Fresno’s Smart City vision as it allows for entrepreneurship , innovation 
and user-engagement. In order to manage the data, the City will use Dell (Intel Based) 
servers, VMWare for virtual services, Cisco networking related equipment and fiber 
internet connections. Internal and external firewalls will provide protection to the data 
generated. 
Investing in low-cost, efficient, secure and resilient information and communication 
technology in conjunction with all vision elements of the Smart City challenge provides 
the City of Fresno the opportunity to reduce long-term costs. Cost savings are realized 
through economies of scale.

technology at scale, rather than incrementally, will position Fresno with the software, 
hardware and capital investment in information equipment needed to execute the Smart 
City vision. 
Vision Element #12: Smart Land Use 
The City of Fresno has taken a balanced approach to land use over the 
last 7 years. The 2035 General Plan and 2015 council  adoption of 
reduced fee policies in target ed areas encourage downtown infill, 
revitalization of blighted neighborhoods and a robust business district. 
The General Plan shifts emphasis from the historically dominated 
suburban growth patterns, to a vision of growth that shares increased 
urban development in the form of infill and rehabilitation, along with new Activity Centers 
with mixed-uses and neighborhoods in growth areas. These Activity Centers are located 
along the planned Bus Rapid Transit system and focus on walkability, complete streets 
and reinvigorating neighborhoods. 
As a Smart City, Fresno would have a more robust transportation dataset for public 
transit and local traffic patterns. This data would add additional information to public and 
private planning and development efforts. By realizing the vision elements included in 
this proposal, the City would have new insights into local challenges which coul d 
potentially be addressed or mitigated through smart land use policy. The Smart City 
vision elements presented support a continued commitment to smart land use. Vision 
Elements maintain Fresno’s focus on improving major arterials through the installation  
of Adaptive ITS, increasing connectivity, and linking mixed use areas to business 
districts to encourage residents to adopt public transit or active transportation 
alternatives. Continued smart land use results in interconnected urban areas, and 
provides the foundation for Vision Elements in this proposal to be realized.  Policies 
which support smart land use are fully woven into City operations and will continue 
throughout the deployment of the Smart City grant and into the future.  
6. Identify and rate key technical, policy, and institutional risks associated with
the deployment vision and discuss plans for mitigating those risks.
As with any major undertaking, the City anticipates some risk related to technical, policy 
and institutional challenges. There are technical details regarding WiFi range near BRT 
stations to explore, transaction fees for mobile technology which can impact operational 
costs, and long-term questions regarding sustainability and maintenance costs for 
Bikeshare programming and DSRC equipment. Each of these risks will require in-depth 
exploration and the identification of solutions to overcome or mitigate barriers to the 
implementation of Smart City Vision Elements. Fortunately, many of the proposed 
Vision Elements are already part of approved plans or technical reports including the 
City of Fresno General Plan , Regional Information Technology Systems Master Plan , "	fresno technology scale rather incrementally position fresno software hardware capital investment information equipment needed execute vision vision element land use fresno taken balanced approach land use last year general plan council adoption reduced fee policy target ed area encourage downtown infill revitalization blighted neighborhood robust business district general plan shift emphasis historically dominated suburban growth pattern vision growth share increased urban development form infill rehabilitation along new activity center mixed us neighborhood growth area activity center located along planned bus rapid transit system focus walkability complete street reinvigorating neighborhood fresno would robust transportation dataset public transit local traffic pattern data would add additional information public private planning development effort realizing vision element included proposal would new insight local challenge coul potentially addressed mitigated land use policy vision element presented support continued commitment land use vision element maintain fresno focus improving major arterials installation adaptive increasing connectivity linking mixed use area business district encourage resident adopt public transit active transportation alternative continued land use result interconnected urban area provides foundation vision element proposal realized policy support land use fully woven operation continue throughout deployment grant future identify rate key technical policy institutional risk associated deployment vision discus plan mitigating risk major undertaking anticipates risk related technical policy institutional challenge technical detail regarding wifi range near brt station explore transaction fee mobile technology impact operational cost long term question regarding sustainability maintenance cost bikeshare programming dsrc equipment risk require depth exploration identification solution overcome mitigate barrier implementation vision element fortunately many proposed vision element already part approved plan technical report including fresno general plan regional information technology system master plan	15

7. Outline team partners, key stakeholders, and demonstration governance
processes. Describe existing and future public and/or private partnerships,
including university research partnerships.
Becoming a Smart City will require interdepartmental collaboration and public-private 
partnerships. The C ity of Fresno’s vision cannot be achieved working in a silo, but must 
be part of a joint effort supported by stakeholders for maximum impact and 
sustainability. Key internal partners  within the city will include Directors, Engineers, 
Project Managers and technical staff from the departments of Public Works, Public 
Utilities, Transportation, Development and Information Services. External partners  may 
include international tech leader, Google, and technological innovation staff from local 
companies such as BitWise. The City of Fresno has been approached by Google X , to 
discuss a pilot for self- driving vehicles. A letter of support expressing Google’s interest 
is attached to this application. Educational institutions will also be key partners in 
creating a Smart City. Local institutions which may collaborate include Fresno State, 
Fresno City College, Fresno Unified School District, Clovis Unified School District, 
Fresno County Office of Education and Central Unified School District. The list of 
partners is not all encompassing, and the City remains open to new opportunities to 
achieve the Smart City vision elements.  
Demonstration governance processes  will be dictated by standard policies and 
procedures, including City of Fresno Administrative Orders and relevant Memoranda of 
Understanding between partners. There is broad support for the initial proposal, as 
evidenced by the letters of support attached to this application.  
8. Describe existing transportation infrastructure and system features in your
city, including: arterial miles, freeway miles , transit services, shared-use
mobility services , information and communication technology (ICT),
intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) including transportation
management centers and field equipment, smart Grid Infrastructure
including electric vehicle charging infrastructure.
Arterial and Freeway Miles 
The City and County public roadway network, together with State highway routes, 
comprise the predominant transportation infrastructure in and around Fresno. The 
roadway system configuration has been primarily based on a traditional grid pattern. 
The oldest part of the city (the traditional Downtown area) is an urban grid oriented to 
the Union Pacific (originally Southern Pacific) railroad alignment that traverses the San 
Joaquin Valley in a northwest to southeast direction. Outside of this area the grid shifts 
to a north-south orientation based on Township, Range and Section lines. Almost all of 
the Arterial and Collector Streets (roadways) within the Metropolitan Area are regularly "	fresno fiber interoperability report smarter finding leadership confident ability mitigate aforementioned risk utilizing effective planning method strategic collaboration outline team partner key stakeholder demonstration governance process describe existing future public private partnership including university research partnership becoming require interdepartmental collaboration public private partnership c ity fresno vision achieved working silo must part joint effort supported stakeholder maximum impact sustainability key internal partner within include director engineer project manager technical staff department public work public utility transportation development information service external partner may include international tech leader google technological innovation staff local company bitwise fresno approached google x discus pilot self driving vehicle letter support expressing google interest attached application educational institution also key partner creating local institution may collaborate include fresno fresno college fresno unified school district clovis unified school district fresno county office education central unified school district list partner encompassing remains open new opportunity achieve vision element demonstration governance process dictated standard policy procedure including fresno administrative order relevant memoranda understanding partner broad support initial proposal evidenced letter support attached application describe existing transportation infrastructure system feature including arterial mile freeway mile transit service shared use mobility service information communication technology ict intelligent transportation system including transportation management center field equipment grid infrastructure including electric vehicle charging infrastructure arterial freeway mile county public roadway network together highway route comprise predominant transportation infrastructure around fresno roadway system configuration primarily based traditional grid pattern oldest part traditional downtown area urban grid oriented union pacific originally southern pacific railroad alignment traverse san joaquin valley northwest southeast direction outside area grid shift north south orientation based township range section line almost arterial collector street roadway within metropolitan area regularly	15

spaced at half-mile intervals. This roadway pattern has been modified in the past 
several decades to include several curvilinear and diagonal alignments, and 
neighborhood street patterns have sometimes deviated from the grid pattern. The City 
of Fresno has approximately 185 arterial miles connecting the community. 
Over time, Fresno’s street circulation system and developed urban form have also been 
framed by limited access State highways that traverse the city. There are approximately 
50 miles of freeway in Fresno. State Route 99 traverses the city from northwest to 
southeast, connecting Fresno to other communities throughout the central and southern 
San Joaquin Valley. State Routes 41 and 180 bisect the city north-south and east-west 
connecting Fresno to Yosemite and Kings Canyon National Parks, respectively. State 
Route 168 links Fresno to Clovis and Sierra Nevada recreational attractions at Shaver 
and Huntington Lakes to the northeast. The construction of the freeway system 
removed a substantial amount of the “through” traffic from the local roadway network 
(e.g.: Blackstone Avenue, Golden State Boulevard, Kings Canyon Road), freeing up 
capacity on the local streets except at intersections near freeway interchanges. This 
urban freeway system has shortened commute times from the northern areas of the city 
and Clovis, and to the east for bedroom communities and foothill communities.  
Transit System & Shared Use Mobility System 
As discussed in question three , the City of Fresno has a robust 
public transit system which includes the FAX bus transportation 
system, a Bus Rapid Transit system on two major arterials 
slated for groundbreaking in 2016, on-demand Handy Ride  
services for eligible persons with disabilities who cannot 
functionally use the fixed route system, and connections to the 
Amtrak and Greyhound public transit systems. Preparations 
are underway for the High Speed Rail (HSR) system, the first of 
its size in the nation, which will connect Fresno to major cities 
and economic hu bs of the Golden State. Fresno’s transit 
system also includes infrastructure which supports multi-modal 
transportation such as walking or riding a bicycle. Fresno 
recently received bronze level recognition for bike lanes 
throughout the city from the League of American Bicyclists.  This is the second 
recognition received since 2011, extending current bronze designation through 2019.  
Information and Communication Technology 
The City of Fresno has adopted advanced Information and communication technology 
which includes Dell (Intel-based) servers, VMWare for virtual servers, Cisco for 
networking equipment and connects to the internet through high speed fiber optic 
infrastructure. Information and communication technology is also is utilized to track 
Fresno’ s FAX system and provide traveler information through San Joaquin Valley 511 
services as well as a mobile friendly website. Information and communication 
technology utilized as part of the FAX system includes Automated Vehicle Location 
Systems (AVLS) software provided by Trapeze ITS.  This is a stand-alone system that 
tracks the location of the FAX bus fleet and transmits real-time bus location information

23 to the FAX Dispatch Center. The AVL system utilizes the 800 MHz narrowband 
conventional spectrum with one data and two voice channels. The current polling rate is 
approximately one poll every 70 seconds. All of the AVL servers (database and 
application servers) are housed at the FAX Administration Building. The AVL database 
server is a virtual Dell power Edge ESXI with dual processors running Microsoft 
Windows Server 2012 R2 and SQL server 2012. The Application server is a virtual Dell 
power Edge ESXI running Microsoft Windows Server 2012 R2. On-board the buses, the 
AVL equipment consists of the Trapeze ITS TransitMaster Gen I and Gen II AVL 
tracking equipment including a VE IVLU Assembly, Tait TM8105 without DR and MDT, 
color and DVI with brightness board. There is also a single line sign with base 
communication software on-board the buses. 
Intelligent Transportation System, Field Equipment and the Traffic Operations 
Center 
Over the last 10 years, the City of Fresno has made a significant capital investment in 
Intelligent Transportation, and has emerged as a leader in the Central Valley through 
the development of a Fresno-Clovis Metropolitan Region Traffic Coordination System. 
In 1995, the City of Fresno embarked on a goal to build a Traffic Operations Center 
(TOC) and a city-wide fiber optic network that would interconnect the City of Fresno, 
City of Clovis, County, Council of Governments, and Caltrans District 6, providing the 
foundation for a coordinated traffic management system. The Advanced Traffic 
Management System (ATMS) has connected the Traffic Operations Center to a fiber 
network, connecting key arterials and expressways for an efficient city-wide traffic 
coordination system. A network of controllers, cameras and radar systems relay “real 
time” traffic or accident information to many C ity departments including: Transportation, 
Transit, Fire and Emergency Services.  
In 2012, the City of Fresno adopted an Intelligent Transportation Systems Management 
Plan which included identified user priorities paired with ITS elements to address and 
mitigate problems such as barriers to communication, and signal coordination. These 
user priorities and ITS elements were paired as part of a 20-month study jointly funded 
by the California Department of Transportation and the individual counties participating 
in the San Joaquin Council of Governments (SJCOG). Bourne out of an extensive 
planning process, crucial funding from the Congestion Mitigation and Air Quality 
program and California’s Proposition 1B , the City of Fresno currently has state- of-the-art 
technology to monitor, model and coordinate traffic on several of the City’s major 
arterials. This  improves safety, operations, energy conservation and the effective 
capacity of major arterials. ITS equipment currently in place includes a Transportation 
Operations Center control facility with client workstations connected to the City LAN with 
access to the Advanced Traffic Management System , a fiber core network switch that 
receives video and data from the traffic signals, CCTV cameras and other periphera l 
devices for the City to remotely monitor and control the field devices. Outside of the 
TOC, there is an extensive fiber-optic network, communication cabinets, vaults and 
splice closures, CCTV cameras and wireless installations placed along traffic signals 
throughout the city. Existing and currently obligated infrastructure is equipped to support 
future needs through the use of wireless technology, and is primed for expansion along "	fresno fax dispatch center avl system utilizes mhz narrowband conventional spectrum one data two voice channel current polling rate approximately one poll every second avl server database application server housed fax administration building avl database server virtual dell power edge esxi dual processor running microsoft window server r sql server application server virtual dell power edge esxi running microsoft window server r board bus avl equipment consists trapeze transitmaster gen gen ii avl tracking equipment including ivlu assembly tait tm without dr mdt color dvi brightness board also single line sign base communication software board bus intelligent transportation system field equipment traffic operation center last year fresno made significant capital investment intelligent transportation emerged leader central valley development fresno clovis metropolitan region traffic coordination system fresno embarked goal build traffic operation center toc wide fiber optic network would interconnect fresno clovis county council government caltrans district providing foundation coordinated traffic management system advanced traffic management system atm connected traffic operation center fiber network connecting key arterials expressway efficient wide traffic coordination system network controller camera radar system relay real time traffic accident information many c ity department including transportation transit fire emergency service fresno adopted intelligent transportation system management plan included identified user priority paired element address mitigate problem barrier communication signal coordination user priority element paired part month study jointly funded california department transportation individual county participating san joaquin council government sjcog bourne extensive planning process crucial funding congestion mitigation air quality program california proposition b fresno currently art technology monitor model coordinate traffic several major arterials improves safety operation energy conservation effective capacity major arterials equipment currently place includes transportation operation center control facility client workstation connected lan access advanced traffic management system fiber core network switch receives video data traffic signal cctv camera periphera l device remotely monitor control field device outside toc extensive fiber optic network communication cabinet vault splice closure cctv camera wireless installation placed along traffic signal throughout existing currently obligated infrastructure equipped support future need use wireless technology primed expansion along	15

9. Define the data your city currently collects.  
 
The City of Fresno collects numerous data points across departments , and practices 
data-driven decision -making . The data current ly collected by the City’s FAX system 
includes: ridership, revenue, service hours and miles, on -time performance, operating 
speeds, average deadhea d time, late pull out percentage (non -revenue and out -of-
service hours) and service related incidents (passengers, equipment, drivers). The data 
currently collected by the Transportation Operations Center  and the Traffic Engineering 
Department includes  traffic patterns  along ITS corridors , incidents, signal timing, 
average daily traffic and accident reports. The data currently  collected by P arking 
include s daily parking revenue for on street and off street meters. Crowd sourced data 
is also collected by  the Information Services Department utilizing the FresGo App.  
 
a. Describe how these data, along with new data to be collected and 
shared during the demonstration may be used by the lead agency, 
project partners, other agencies and stakeholders to further a ddress 
city challenges.  
 
As it relates to traffic, n ew d ata to be collected during the demonstration includes  all of 
the data discussed in the previous section,  as well as intersection specific traffic 
patterns  through out the city , travel time, queue length,  pedestrian travel patterns, 
emergency preemption,  emissions, peak volumes, green times and weather patterns.  
With respect to public transportation, sales data from upgraded TVMs and trends in trip 
planning data would be collected. This data would be made  publicly available and/or 
licensed following Memoranda of Understanding which would be completed in 
conjunction with public and privat e partners following City of Fresno procedures. This 
data could be  used to support policy making and shift public transit  to address areas of 
congestion  and demand for services . It could also be used to inform future grants  to 
provide funding to address city challenges or improve active transportation planning.  
 
b. Describe how transportation data could integrate with other fun ctions 
or services in a city (such as public safety, human services, transit, 
and public works) to improve the management and operations of the 
city.  
 
Data from newly A daptive ITS traffic signals will integrate with FAX  public transit  data to 
create a more effective public transportation system . Much of this integration will be 
done autonomously through computer algorithms.  This autonomous calculation will 
save staff time and increase efficiency in signal timing.  Additionally, r eports which 
include exte nsive time -series data points collected at traffic  signals would be reviewed 
for insights into best practices and  areas for improvement . The City would also be able 
to quantify emissions in new ways, and thus adjust traffic patterns as feasible  to mitigate

 data that will be generated, the City of Fresno anticipates significant benefit to 
manage ment and operations city -wide.   
 
c. Likewise, describe how other data could be integrated with 
transportation data to improve transportation operations.  
 
Other data could be integrated with transportation data to improve transportation 
operations through co llaboration with educational institutions and social service 
agencies . For example, data from social service agencies and educational institutions 
regarding  peak demand and  course scheduling can be used to inform FAX public transit 
planning so that public transit routes can adjust frequency or timin g to accommodate 
peak demand . This would allow for greater coordination city -wide, which would 
ultimately encourage incr eased ridership and use of multi -modal travel options.  
 
d. Describe any existing policies and identify their sources (local 
executive order or policy, local ordinance or state legislation, etc.) 
applicable to the proposed data to be collected and shared as pa rt of 
the proposed project.  
 
There are currently no  City of Fresno  Administrative Orders that apply to data collection 
and distribution. Given the nature of the data to be collected in the Smart City 
Challenge, City of Fresno staff will work closely with the City Attorney’s office to ensure 
all legal guidelines are followed within this project.  
 
e. Submissions describing cross -cutting partnerships to advance smart 
city technologies, related programs and policies are encouraged, but 
not required. If you plan t o partner with outside organizations 
(nonprofits, universities, corporations, etc.) you should address 
whether and specify how (e.g., limitation on sharing or use) data from 
those organizations or interests will be collected , managed, and 
shared across sec tors or with the public, if appropriate. Identify 
candidate data that is expected to be shared, used, and used for other 
purposes by the participating project partners or with the public.   
 
The City of Fresno has many interested partners from both the publ ic and private 
sector. Should the City of Fresno be selected as a Smart City, a ll partnerships will 
follow City of Fresno guidelines to obtain any relevant Memoranda of Understanding  
and/or  Letters of A greement to clearly identify roles and relationships with respect to 
data sharing.  
 
f. Describe the terms and conditions that exist or will be established  and 
managed in partnership agreements, data or information sharing 
agreements, agency specific policies and operating procedures to 
establish and maintain the systems and interfaces to maintain the

Terms and c onditions and any partnership agreements established will be developed 
following existing City of Fresno procedures  and legal guidelines. Given the innovative 
nature of many of the elements in the proposal, terms and conditi ons will need to be 
developed alongside project scoping and tailored specifically to data sharing.  The City 
of Fresno has extensive experience with collaboration and is confident terms and 
conditions can be established and managed between partners.  
 
10. Descri be your approach for using existing standards, architectures, and 
certification processes for ITS and connected vehicle based technologies 
and plans for documenting experiences and cooperating with architecture 
and standards developers to improve the quali ty of these products based on 
lessons learned in deployment.  
 
All ITS technologies will be  adopted based on standards and architectures which allow it 
to fully integrate into existing systems. The City of Fresno has published Standard 
Drawings and Specifications that are utilized for all new traffic signal and ITS 
installations and modifications. These standards and architectures comply with Federal 
Highway Administration guidelines as well as n ational ITS standards from the 
Department of Transportati on, and the 2015 Fresno County I ntelligent Transportation 
System Strategic Deployment Plan  developed in conjunction with the Fresno Council of 
Governments. Connected vehicle technologies will adhere to Dedicated Short Range 
Communic ations (DSRC) systems standards from  the Department of Transportation 
which are currently under development.  The City of Fresno plans to  share best 
practices and challenge s faced in deploying the products to better inform S mart Cities of 
the future. Th is documentation and cooperative  effort could be established through 
meetings, regular correspondence and standardized progress reports which identify 
lessons learned .  
 
11. Provide measurable goals and objectives for your vision and describe your 
approach for monitoring the impact of the demonstration on mobility, safety, 
efficiency, sustainability, and climate change.  Note: The selected city for the 
demonstration will be re sponsible for identifying a set of targeted 
performance measures that relate to the primary impact of their proposed 
deployment.  The system deployed must be capable of generating the data 
needed to calculate these measures over time – that is, to show how well the 
system is performing with respect to these target measures. Independent 
evaluation will also be required to validate site system performance with 
respect to the targeted measures, to collect or infer contextual data that 
allows for the isolation a nd mitigation of confounding factors, and to provide 
supplementary evaluation with respect to a broader set of safety, 
environmental, mobility and public agency efficiency measures of interest to 
USDOT.  Sites are responsible for supporting the independent evaluator‟s 
access to the site and to site staff to conduct evaluation -related experiments, 
interviews, and surveys.

30 The City of Fresno has a comprehensive staffing structure in place made up of highly 
skilled executives, engineers, information technology experts, transportation and 
planning teams which equip the City to take on a project of this magnitude. Executive, 
management and technical staff across City Departments have been engaged in the 
preparation of this proposal, and will be fully involved in transforming the City of Fresno 
into a Smart City. Represented departments include: Public Works, Transportation, 
Information Services, Development and Parking. Workforce capacity exists through 
teams of designers and project manager s who currently oversee the City’s capital 
projects, have well established systems in place and regularly advance projects from 
concept to completion. Over the last two fiscal years, the Department of Public Works 
alone has delivered over $16.5 million in intelligent transportation systems, road 
maintenance and active transportation capital projects. 
The City of Fresno Information Services Department (ISD) manages large amounts of 
data successfully, and has the capacity to accommodate Smart City needs. ISD is 
broken down into four key divisions including Administration, Communications, 
Computer Services, and Systems and Applications. These divisions have the technical 
expertise to manage telecommunication, network infrastructure, AS/400 operations and 
traffic operations, enterprise-wide applications, database administration, GIS and web 
development. 
A more synchronized traffic system throughout the entire city provides the foundation of 
our Smart City vision. ITS infrastructure to accomplish each of the vision elements and 
goals included in this plan is under development, meets industry standards and can be 
leveraged to advance the proposed objectives. The City of Fresno Department of Traffic 
Engineering has gained extensive experience in synchronization projects, and is 
currently overseeing construction on 12 corridors spanning 58.5 miles with a projected 
emissions reduction of 225,255 lbs per year.  
Where infrastructure is currently unavailable, extensive feasibility studies, white papers, 
requests for proposals, reports and long-range plans provide well researched and 
informed “next steps” for infrastructural improvements. For cutting edge technologies, 
the combined years of experience within the City of Fresno department leadership and 
well established stakeholder relationships provide the kind of expertise needed to pave 
the way .  
13. Describe any opportunities to leverage Federal resources through cost
share, in-kind donations, and partnering.
The City of Fresno maintains a substantial portfolio of federally funded projects which 
are currently changing the transportation landscape across Fresno. Past and current 
projects have laid the foundation for many of the vision elements in this proposal. The 
City of Fresno plans to explore partnerships with local universities to support bike share 
efforts, and leverage existing partnerships to maximize funding. Please find attached to 
this application numerous letters of support from partners in the public and private 
sectors.
